# JavaScript Type Coercion Pitfall
This code demonstrates a common pitfall in JavaScript related to type coercion.  When performing operations with mixed data types (e.g., numbers and strings), JavaScript's automatic type conversion can lead to unexpected results.  The example shows how adding a number and a string results in string concatenation instead of numerical addition.

The solution demonstrates how to avoid this by explicitly converting the string to a number before the addition.

This repository serves as a simple illustration of this issue and a demonstration of how to handle it correctly.
